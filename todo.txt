~~~~~ GOAL ~~~~~

From js query wasm sqlite with the same api as websql. Make it persist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doing:
x import the code to get the speed test working
- get build of including a c function and console logging working
- consult sql.js to understand how they do the includes, mimic the include of open and exec
- get wrapped version working in memory, no pthreadfs
- get that working in a web worker
- get that working with pthreadfs
- translate speed test to js and write a test

Absorbing:
- virtual memory chapter
- filesystem chapter
- multithreading chapter


What I *think* I know:
- I think operations must run in a pthread
  - What is my understanding of the wasm runtime? How pthread work in wasm?


Questions:
- What would it look like if I just wanted to use the c api for querying in the command line?
  - this seems workable just from the text editor example and existing methods
- How is their code using the peristant filesystem?



can modify how sql js is modularized:
